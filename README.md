[Resident and recruited macrophages differentially contribute to cardiac healing after myocardial ischemia](https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/89377)

The bulk-RNAseq plots were created using the jupyter-notebook `ManuscriptPlots.ipynb`.

The scRNA-seq plots are derived from the analysis described in the `analysis_final.Rmd` file.
